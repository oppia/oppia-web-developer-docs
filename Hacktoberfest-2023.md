## For non-code contributors

If you’re not a coder, don’t worry! Hacktoberfest has introduced a [low/non-code contribution option](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code), so you can still participate, and there are lots of opportunities to do so :)

We have a lot of non-code-contribution opportunities available, including giving talks, organizing case studies, translating, illustrations, graphic design and creating practice questions. To learn more about these opportunities, please check out our [hacktoberfest-2023-non-code-contributions GitHub repo](https://github.com/oppia/hacktoberfest-2023-non-code-contributions) and its [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/hacktoberfest-2023-non-code-contributions/issues)!

## Donations

You can also support the Oppia open source project through donations! Please see the [Hacktoberfest page](https://hacktoberfest.com/donate/) or our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oppia) page for more information. We truly appreciate your support!


## FAQ

**Q: What is Hacktoberfest?**

A: Hacktoberfest is an annual event across all of GitHub which is meant to encourage developers to contribute to open source projects.

**Q: Must we only work on issues marked with the Hacktoberfest label?**

A: Not necessarily! **Any** pull request will count toward your 4, even if you are fixing an issue that doesn't have the Hacktoberfest label. Issues with the Hacktoberfest label are just meant to provide some starter ideas for newcomers. Feel free to browse issues in our different [team project boards](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to see if there is something you’d like to work on.

**Q: Do pull requests need to have the Hacktoberfest label to count?**

A: Nope! No information from GitHub, Digital Ocean, and Dev seems to indicate that this is necessary.

**Q: Do I need to mention that I am participating in Hacktoberfest when I open my PR?**

A: No, but if you mention in your PR description that you are participating in Hacktoberfest, we *might* be able to add the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label if your PR looks good but doesn't get through the full review process before the end of October. That said, we prefer that PRs get fully merged, so we recommend starting early!
