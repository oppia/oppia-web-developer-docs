Thanks for your interest in contributing art to the Oppia community project! We recognize the importance of great visual design: images can often communicate a message more clearly than words, and they convey a large part of the site's tone and ambience.

Here are some ways in which you can help:

  * **Help create essential art for the site.** We have [several needs](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20art) for artistic assets, but nowhere near enough artists. If you'd like to help out with any of them, please sign in to GitHub and leave a comment on the appropriate issue, and we'd be happy to help you get started!

  * **Improve an exploration.** Some explorations on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) have lots of dense text which might be better replaced or supplemented with an image. Others have images that ... could be better. You can identify these explorations, and leave a piece of feedback mentioning that you'd be happy to help with improving the images. If the exploration is community-editable, you could also make the changes directly.

  * **Create an exploration.** If you have a storytelling bent, consider creating an interactive exploration on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org). The editing tools make it possible to bring dry concepts to life by simulating an interactive conversation with a tutor, and you can make these conversations as interesting as you like! We want the learning experience to be one of joy and discovery, and if you can create an exploration which permits this, it would set a great example for other creators.

Along the way, if you run into any issues, please feel free to file an issue using our [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues), make a post to our [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), or send an email to the admin team at admin@oppia.org. We'll do our best to help!
