### `[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`
If after running `python -m scripts.start` you get the following lines:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/vansh/.pyenv/versions/3.8.15/lib/python3.8/urllib/request.py", line 1354, in do_open
    h.request(req.get_method(), req.selector, req.data, headers,

    self.endheaders(body, encode_chunked=encode_chunked)
  File "/home/vansh/.pyenv/versions/3.8.15/lib/python3.8/http/client.py", line 1251, in endheaders

    self.sock = self._context.wrap_socket(self.sock,
  File "/home/vansh/.pyenv/versions/3.8.15/lib/python3.8/ssl.py", line 500, in wrap_socket
    return self.sslsocket_class._create(
  File "/home/vansh/.pyenv/versions/3.8.15/lib/python3.8/ssl.py", line 1040, in _create
    self.do_handshake()

    self._sslobj.do_handshake()
ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
```
Then run `pip install requests[security]`.

### `No module named builtins`

If after running `python -m scripts.start` you get the following lines:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 174, in _run_module_as_main
   "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 72, in _run_code
   exec code in run_globals
File "/home/user/oppia/oppia/scripts/start.py", line 30, in <module>
  import python_utils
File "python_utils.py", line 36, in <module>
  import builtins  # isort:skip
ImportError: No module named builtins
```

Then run `pip install future`.

### No Java

If running `which java` on the terminal does not return any output, you do not have java installed. You can install it by running `sudo apt install openjdk-7-jre-headless`. Note that this command might vary for your local machine.

### Frontend Tests Stuck

If you're unable to run frontend tests while pushing your changes due to the script getting stuck, please go to "node_modules" directory (located at the same level as that of the root directory) and delete the "webdriverio" directory present inside that folder.

### Selenium Server Not Killed by Ctrl-C

If the selenium server is not killed on pressing Ctrl-C and you get an error something like this:

```
  LocalError: Either another browserstack local client is running on your machine or some server is
  listening on port 45691
```

You can kill the process manually by `sudo lsof -t -i:45691` or `sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:45691)`.
These commands can be used anywhere to kill a running process on any port by using the appropriate port number.

### 403 Error

If you get 403 error while serving Oppia locally, this can be because you are working behind a proxy.

go to `oppia_tools/google-cloud-sdk-XXX.X.X/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/` and open the `appengine_rpc.py` file. Comment the following line in it. `opener.add_handler(ProxyHandler())`. Run the server again.

[Resource for outdated version of the App Engine.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16698621/google-app-engine-error-httperror/17522082)

### MERGE_MSG Newer than Swap File

If you’re seeing issues when trying to merge from upstream/develop that say something like `While opening file “/Users/….../oppia/.git/MERGE_MSG” dated: ….. NEWER than swap file!` then try following the given instructions in the error message (more info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13361729/found-a-swap-file-by-the-name/13361874)). If that doesn’t work, your forked repo may be out of sync with Oppia’s. Make sure your develop branch does NOT have any changes or commits that aren’t present on the original Oppia repo.

### Warnings from `start.py`

**Note:** There may be a few warnings that appear after running `start.py`. Don’t worry about these so long as you see the Oppia home page once you go to http://localhost:8181. The script should continue to run so long as the development server is on (you’ll see a lot of lines that start with “INFO”) and you’re able to navigate to the page.

### No Such File or Directory: Google Cloud SDK

If you see an error that says something along the lines of `OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/.../opensource/oppia_tools/google-cloud-sdk-XXX.X.X/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/google/appengine'` while running `scripts.start` - then try deleting the `../oppia_tools` directory and then running `scripts.start` again.

### No module named '\_sqlite3'

If you see an error that says something along the lines of `ERROR: gcloud failed to load: No module named _sqlite3` while running `scripts.start` - then follow the steps below:

1. Uninstall Python 3.8.15 from pyenv with the command: `pyenv uninstall 3.8.15`
2. Install the packages as per the [wiki](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment) to have the suggested build environment.
3. Install Python 3.8.15 from pyenv with the command: `pyenv install 3.8.15` and make sure that there are no warnings or errors in the output of the command.

### Problems Cloning from GitHub

If you have issues cloning the GitHub repository, make sure of the following:

1. That you’ve already [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the Oppia repository
2. That you’re making sure to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced) from your own fork (making sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oppia.git` with your GitHub username)
3. If you have two-factor authentication (which you should), that you’re typing in your [access token](https://webkul.com/blog/github-push-with-two-factor-authentication/) as your password when prompted (rather than your GitHub password).

### Certificate Verify Failed

If you see an error that says something like, `IOError: [Errno socket error] [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed` then try applying the fix detailed in [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49183801/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-with-urllib).

### No Module Named Scripts

If you see an error that contains `No module named scripts` when trying to run any of our scripts, then make sure that you’re currently in the correct folder (i.e. the directory called `oppia` that directly contains the `scripts` directory). Note that, in general, all scripts should be run from oppia/ (and not from scripts/ or other directories). You can find more information about how to navigate folders using the command line [here](https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html).

### Invalid Syntax

If you repeatedly get errors with `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` for a module or class that you didn’t edit and/or is part of a third party library, then try doing either of the following…

- Be sure that libraries were installed using Python 3. If not, uninstall all Python 2 environments and reinstall everything in Python 3.
- Delete the `oppia_tools` directory and rerun the script

### Java Read Past EOF

If you run into the following error when running `start.py`, you can follow the answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55885634), which says to run `../oppia_tools/elasticsearch-7.10.1/bin/elasticsearch-keystore create` (run it from opensource/oppia/). When prompted, confirm to manually overwrite the key already created.

```
Exception in thread "main" java.io.EOFException: read past EOF: SimpleFSIndexInput(path="/home/[user]/opensource/oppia_tools/elasticsearch-7.10.1/config/elasticsearch.keystore")
```

### Low RAM

Oppia does not work well on machines with little available memory. Contributors have reported problems running on machines with less than 4 GB of RAM that were resolved when switching to a machine with 8 GB of RAM. You may also experience problems if your computer has memory-intensive tasks running. See [#12098](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/12098) for an example of how this problem can manifest.

For possible workarounds, see [[Failed to Start Server on Port XXXX|Troubleshooting#failed-to-start-server-on-port-xxxx]].

### Failed to Start Server on Port XXXX

If you see `Failed to start server on port XXXX, exiting ...` here are some possible solutions:

- Sometimes this happens because the service is taking a long time to start running on that port. If the service takes longer than our timeout, you'll see this message. To fix this, you can increase the timeout in `scripts/common.py` by increasing the value of `MAX_WAIT_TIME_FOR_PORT_TO_OPEN_SECS`. This can also happen when your machine is running more slowly than usual. Quitting resource-intensive applications or rebooting may help.
- Sometimes this happens because the server earlier failed to shutdown correctly. You may need to kill remaining processes. You can search for processes containing `oppia`, and `elasticsearch` like this: `ps -ax | grep <search term>`. This will show the process ID numbers, which you can pass to `kill` to kill the process like this: `kill <process ID>`.
- Some developers have found that they have to run some services manually to get Oppia to work. This is an unsupported workaround, but you may find it useful:

  - Redis (port 6379) on M1 macs:
    1. Install Rosetta 2 try [this](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64882584/how-to-run-the-homebrew-installer-under-rosetta-2-on-m1-macbook%23:~:text%3DYou%2520can%2520run%2520Terminal%2520with,%2522Open%2520using%2520Rosetta%2522%2520option&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1611504651223000&usg=AFQjCNFhJysGCAFdzLswFuK5JVoxjs6CwQ)
    2. Inside Rosetta perform all the installations/prerequisites.
       Note: If `sudo easy_install pyyaml` does not work try using `pip install pyyaml`.
    3. Open the Rosetta terminal and download redis server using `pip install redis`.
    4. Run redis-server with the following cmd: `redis-server` (**Don't stop the redis server**)
    5. Open another rosetta terminal and run `python -m scripts.start`
  - Elasticsearch (port 9200):

    ```console
    $ oppia_tools/elasticsearch-<version>/bin/elasticsearch
    ```

    For some version number `<version>`.

### Failed to connect to raw.githubusercontent.com port 443

Change the DNS address to 8.8.8.8 or change your network/WiFi.

### `./portserver.socket is not listed in the .github/CODEOWNERS file`

Just delete the `./portserver.socket` file. It's generated automatically by the end-to-end tests and is supposed to be cleaned up automatically. However, if your tests don't exit cleanly, the file can get left behind, which causes lint failures. The file is just a socket for communication between processes, so it's safe to delete once the tests exit.

### Push fails due to connection timeout

If you use SSH for your GitHub remote URL, you may find that when you run `git push` and the tests pass, your commits don't show up on GitHub. When this happens, the end of the terminal output after `git push` will look like this:

```text
...
Done!
------------------------------------
All Frontend Coverage Checks Passed.
------------------------------------
Already on ...
```

Notice that there is no output showing that commits were pushed. To fix this, use an HTTPS remote URL for GitHub as specified in our [[installation instructions|Installing-Oppia]].

You can check your remote URLs like this:

```console
$ git remote -v
origin     https://github.com/{{GITHUB USERNAME}}/oppia.git (fetch)
origin     https://github.com/{{GITHUB USERNAME}}/oppia.git (push)
upstream   https://github.com/oppia/oppia.git (fetch)
upstream   https://github.com/oppia/oppia.git (push)
```

If you see SSH URLs, fix them like this:

```console
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{{GITHUB USERNAME}}/oppia.git
$ git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/oppia/oppia.git
```

Once you've fixed this, you should see this at the end of your output from `git push`:

```text
...
Done!
------------------------------------
All Frontend Coverage Checks Passed.
------------------------------------
Already on ...
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads

To github.com:{{GITHUB USERNAME}}/oppia.git
   cfb1f9e..e3f8d66  cleanup -> cleanup
```

Note that the output above will look somewhat different for you since it's specific to what data you're pushing.

### Exception: Error compiling proto files

If you are getting something like this in M1 macbooks when running `python -m scripts.start`:

```
b'protoc-gen-js: program not found or is not executable\Please specify a program using absolute path or make sure the program is available in your PATH system variable\n--js_out: protoc-gen-js: Plugin failed with status code 1. Inplugin js: exit status 1\n
Traceback (most recent call last) :

      raise Exception ('Error compiling proto files at %s' % path)
   Exception: Error compiling proto files at /Users/.../opensource/oppia/third_party/oppia-ml-proto-0.0.0
```

Try searching for where protoc is installed (probably in `/opt/homebrew/bin/protoc`) and remove it and then re-run the command.

## Linux

### Python 2 is not available

If you get error like this when running `python -m scripts.start`:

```
ERROR: (dev_appserver) python2: command not found
```

you will need to install Python 2 on your platform, even though Oppia doesn't use Python 2 anymore some parts of the App Engine dev server still need it. If you are on Ubuntu, you should be able to fix this using `sudo apt install python2`.

### OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

If you get an error like this

```
  File "/home/…/oppia/oppia_tools/google-cloud-sdk-335.0.0/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/devappserver2/module.py", line 231, in _create_instance_factory

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 1047, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

please follow the instructions mentioned in [#13672](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/13672) to fix it.

### Pip: Cannot Import Name Main

If you get an error while running install_third_party.py which ends with:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/pip", line 9, in <module>
from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main
```

Try running `$ python -m pip uninstall pip` followed by running `$ python -m scripts.install_third_party` (source: [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49964093/file-usr-bin-pip-line-9-in-module-from-pip-import-main-importerror-canno)).

### ENOSPC: System Limit for Number of File Watchers Reached

If you get an error while running a local server which says something like this:

```
'watch' errored after 789 ms
Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch 'some filename'
```

then you will need to increase the number of system watchers by running the command:

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

Use the same command in the cases where the changes made by you to files are not being detected by the server. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22475849/node-js-what-is-enospc-error-and-how-to-solve/32600959#32600959 for more details.


### No Module functools_lru_cache

If you get an error of the format:

```
ImportError: No module named functools_lru_cache
```

First check the directory `../oppia_tools/pylint-1.9.4` and if it is empty, re-install the missing prerequisites by running:

```
python -m scripts.start
```

If the directory is not empty and you still get the same error, try installing matplotlib by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
```

### No Module appengine.api

If after running `python -m scripts.linters.pre_commit_linter`, you get an error that contains:

```
No module named appengine.api
```

If you're not using a virtual environment, make sure that the path to the appengine lib is locatable. Also, make sure that there are no other versions of google libraries installed globally which may cause path conflict issues. Refer to [this blog](https://medium.com/@maanavshah/fixing-python-import-error-no-module-named-appengine-ebcb540e7f18) for more reference.
If this error occurs within a virtual environment, try reinstalling the libs by running clean.py followed by start.py.

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \_bz2

1. Install bz2 headers. Use the command `sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev` on Ubuntu.
2. Install Python 3 again so that the bz2 library gets included in `~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.15/lib/python3.8/`. Use the command `pyenv install 3.8.15`.

## Mac OS

### Python 2 is not available

If you get error like this when running `python -m scripts.start`:

```
ERROR: (dev_appserver) python2: command not found
```

you will need to install Python 2 on your platform, even though Oppia doesn't use Python 2 anymore some parts of the App Engine dev server still need it. If you have MacOS >= 12.3, please follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-(Mac-OS;-Python-3)#install-prerequisites) to install Python 2 on your system.

### Error: alert_on_exit() -> Iterator[None]

If after running python -m scripts.start, you get an error similar to this below:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 163, in _run_module_as_main
    mod_name, _Error)
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 119, in _get_module_details
    code = loader.get_code(mod_name)
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/pkgutil.py", line 281, in get_code
    self.code = compile(source, self.filename, 'exec')
  File "/Users/Desktop/opensource-oppia/oppia/scripts/start.py", line 85
    def alert_on_exit() -> Iterator[None]:
```

Then,

1. Open your `.bash_profile` file, and check if there are two versions of Python listed inside of it, one for Python 2.7 and other for Python 3.8. Simply remove the entry for Python 2.7. Finally, this is how your file should look like:

```
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"

eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

# Setting PATH for Python 3.10
# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
```

2. Reload the .bash_profile by doing “source .bash_profile”, and now start your Oppia server `python -m scripts.start`.

**Note:** Even if the bash_profile file doesn’t contain two entries for Python version per #1, please do #2 in order to make sure that the new version of Python is set for the virtual environment.

### Local datastore data are not being deleted

In some cases it is possible that the local datastore data are not deleted when the server is rerun, you can delete the data by running `curl -X POST http://localhost:8089/reset` when the devserver is running.

### No module named '\_ctypes' on M1 Macs

When one contributor got a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ctypes'` error when installing on an M1 Mac with Rosetta, they found that using Python 3.9 worked.

### Cannot Import Name `_imaging`

After running `python -m scripts.start`, if you get an error around the following lines:

```
     File "/opensource/oppia/core/platform/models.py", line 176, in import_gae_image_services
         from core.platform.image import gae_image_services
     File "/opensource/oppia/core/platform/image/gae_image_services.py", line 20, in <module>

   ImportError: cannot import name _imaging
```

> **Note**
> [Google search results]
(https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#warnings) indicate that PIL and Pillow cannot coexist in the same environment

First stop the script running with Ctrl + C (or Command-period on a MAC).
Try uninstalling PIL:

```
  $ pip uninstall PIL
```

Then, uninstall and reinstall Pillow

```
  $ pip uninstall pillow
  $ pip install pillow
```

Finally, try running the `python -m scripts.start` script again.

### Command cc failed with exit status 1

If you encounter an issue during the installation of the PIL library on MacOS Mojave V10.14.x, which includes a lot of meaningless characters and contains logs such as:

* `error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1`

* `error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1`

then try running this command on terminal ([reference](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3438)):

```

### SSL Wrong Version Number

If you get an error with `IOError: [Errno socket error] [SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER] wrong version number (_ssl.c:727)` at the bottom, one contributor found that the error occurred intermitently. If you rerun your command, you should get further down the list of files to download. Keep rerunning until all the downloads succeed.

### SSL Verification Issues

If all else fails, and you run into SSL related issues while installing third party libs, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40857561) is what worked for one contributor. **WARNING This disables all SSL verification, so use at your own risk!**

### Yarn: ESOCKETTIMEDOUT

If you get an error like this when running `python -m scripts.start`:

```

info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...
info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...

error An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/mathjs/-/mathjs-9.5.2.tgz: ESOCKETTIMEDOUT".
info If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in /opensource/oppia/yarn-error.log".
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install for documentation about this command.
```

Try running `yarn install --network-timeout 100000`, where the timeout value is in milliseconds. If that doesn’t work, try running the command with a larger network timeout value and keep increasing the timeout (e.g. adding a zero at the end of the value) until it succeeds. Then try running `python -m scripts.start` again. Note: To see if you've raised the timeout enough, you only need to run `yarn install`. You don’t need to run `python -m scripts.start` every time.

## Windows

### Windows Firewall

It's possible that Windows firewall might be preventing localhost:8181 to launch. In such a case, you should re-config the firewall by adding new inbound rule so that ports 8181 and 8000 are allowed. (Instruction about how to add inbound rules can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh168549(v=nav.90).aspx))

### No Such File or Directory /dev/disk/by-id

If you get this error

```
[OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: `/dev/disk/by-id/`
```

try fixing it by adding the `--no_browser` argument to your command, e.g. `python -m scripts.start --no_browser`.

### First build never completed

If you are running on Windows with WSL2 and a relatively small amount of RAM (<16 GB), you might see this error:

```

```

The error code 137 indicates that the Angular compiler ran out of memory. This happens because WSL2 only gives the host operating system (Ubuntu, in our case) 50% of the machine's RAM by default. If you have 8 GB RAM, for example, this means Ubuntu only gets 4 GB, which is insufficient to run Oppia. To fix this, you need to follow [Microsoft's instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config) to increase the amount of RAM given to the host operating system.

## Docker Setup

### docker-desktop : Depends: docker-ce-cli but it is not installable

While installing Docker Desktop, ubuntu users might see the following error logs:
```
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
 
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 docker-desktop : Depends: docker-ce-cli but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

The cause of this error is the absence of the Docker repository installation on the system. To address this issue, a straightforward solution is to execute the following commands before installing Docker Desktop:
```
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update -y
```
These commands are used to prepare an Ubuntu system for Docker installation. They start by installing necessary packages like ca-certificates, gnupg, and lsb-release. Then, a directory named /etc/apt/keyrings is created to store GPG keys. Next, a Docker GPG key is downloaded from the Docker repository and converted to binary format before being saved in the keyring directory. A Docker repository source is added to the APT sources list using an echo command, specifying the architecture, GPG key location, repository URL, and Ubuntu version. Finally, the package list is updated to include Docker packages from the newly added repository. These steps collectively enable secure access to Docker packages and facilitate their installation and management on the system.

Following the completion of the aforementioned commands, you can proceed with the installation of Docker Desktop.

[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72299444/docker-desktop-doesnt-install-saying-docker-ce-cli-not-installable) for the solution stated.

### make commands: `Operation not permitted`

Some users might face the following error while running `make` commands:
```
Operation not permitted
make: *** [Makefile:14: docker] Error 1
```

The simple solution for the above error is to run the make commands with admin access i.e. with `sudo`, example:
```
sudo make build
```
The cause of the issue is that Docker daemon binds to a unix socker by default, which is owned by root. So, when you run the make commands without admin access, it is not able to access the unix socket and hence the error is thrown.
