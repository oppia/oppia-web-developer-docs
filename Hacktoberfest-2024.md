## FAQ

**Q: What is Hacktoberfest?**

A: Hacktoberfest is an annual event across all of GitHub which is meant to encourage developers to contribute to open source projects.

**Q: Must we only work on issues marked with the Hacktoberfest label?**

A: Not necessarily! **Any** pull request will count toward your 4, even if you are fixing an issue that doesn't have the Hacktoberfest label. Issues with the Hacktoberfest label are just meant to provide some starter ideas for newcomers. Feel free to browse issues in our different [team project boards](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to see if there is something you’d like to work on.

**Q: Do pull requests need to have the Hacktoberfest label to count?**

A: Nope! No information from GitHub, Digital Ocean, and Dev seems to indicate that this is necessary.

**Q: Do I need to mention that I am participating in Hacktoberfest when I open my PR?**

A: No, but if you mention in your PR description that you are participating in Hacktoberfest, we *might* be able to add the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label if your PR looks good but doesn't get through the full review process before the end of October. That said, we prefer that PRs get fully merged, so we recommend starting early!
