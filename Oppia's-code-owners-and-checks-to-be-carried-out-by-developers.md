At Oppia, we constantly try to improve the code quality and the experience for both the developers and the end users. This requires many optimizations and checks to make sure that things don't break down or cause any degradation to the users' experience. This is why we have a group of code-owners for specific folders and files who keep a check on the changes to make sure all goes smoothly.

Also, the developers who are making the changes to any files must bear in mind the checks they need to perform on their changes making sure it conforms to the rules the folder/file is bound to.

The following is a list of the code-owners and the checks the code-owner looks for in the corresponding folders/files.

<li>In addition to end to end tests, developer must also verify that the prediction output by these services are same as one that would be generated by Oppia-ml, if it were to do prediction. This is important because Oppia-ml uses libraries for training whereas these files are hand coded and their accuracy should match to the one generated by libraries.

<ul>

<li>Make sure they run optimally. Any common setup needs to be written in BeforeAll blocks.

<li>The test follows a user's path for using the feature.

<li>Enough assertions (and meaningful ones) are made, which ensures that the state the test has reached matches the expected state.

<li>There should be no manipulation using the code. The complete code should test a feature using just the UI.

<li>The tests should be granular, and test a specific functionality. E.g, add a hint, add a translation, etc.

<li>Tests must cover non-happy paths (error-prone paths) if applicable. Like, what happens when the uploaded audio is too big?

</ul>

<p>
For protractor_utils:
<ul>

<li>Make sure style guidelines and naming guidelines are followed.

<li>All protractor classes must start with protractor-test-.

</ul>

<p>
For protractor_mobile, the tests should run successfully on Browserstack.

Also make sure your PR meets all the points in the [codeowners checklist on the wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/End-to-End-Tests#codeowner-checks).
