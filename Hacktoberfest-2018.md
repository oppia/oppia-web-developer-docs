# FAQ
**Q: What is Hacktoberfest?**

A: Hacktoberfest is an annual event across all of GitHub which is meant to encourage developers to contribute to open source projects.

**Q: Must we only work on issues marked with the Hacktoberfest label?**

A: Not necessarily! **Any** pull request will count toward your 5, even if you are fixing an issue that doesn't have the Hacktoberfest label. Issues with the Hacktoberfest label are just meant to provide some starter ideas for newcomers.

**Q: Do pull requests need to have the Hacktoberfest label to count?**

A: Nope! No information from GitHub, Digital Ocean, or Twilio seems to indicate that this is necessary.
