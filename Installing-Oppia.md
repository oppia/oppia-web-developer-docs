__If you are looking for more elaborate instructions on how to get started with Oppia, go to [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up).__

To install the Python 3 version of Oppia, follow these instructions:

* [[Linux|Installing-Oppia-(Linux;-Python-3)]]
* [[Mac OS|Installing-Oppia-(Mac-OS;-Python-3)]]
* [[Windows|Installing-Oppia-(Windows;-Python-3)]]

You might need to install an older version of Oppia that uses Python 2. Only do this when you need to get some older code working or you need to make some changes to a release that is not in Python 3 yet. To do so, follow these instructions for your platform:

* [[Linux|Installing-Oppia-(Linux)]]
* [[Mac OS|Installing-Oppia-(Mac-OS)]]
* [[Windows|Installing-Oppia-(Windows)]] (might be a bit complicated, we recommend to use Linux or Mac if you can)

If you run into any problems during installation, please read [[these notes|Issues-with-installation?]] and the [[Troubleshooting page|Troubleshooting]].

Take a look at our [[guide for getting started with some common code editors|Tips-for-common-IDEs]].

**Warning:** You should always edit Oppia code on your local machine. Do not use web-based editors like github.dev or the editor on github.com. These web-based editors won't run the automated checks that run on your local machine. Pushing without these checks just means that the tests will fail on your PR.
