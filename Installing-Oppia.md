__[If you are looking for more elaborate instructions on how to get started with Oppia, go to [setting things up](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up)]__

Following is the list of installation instructions for various platforms:
1. Create a new, empty folder called `opensource/`. If you're transferring to Python 3 version and still want to keep the older Python 2 version of Oppia please create some other folder with a different name.
2. Navigate to the folder (`cd opensource/`) then [fork and clone](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Fork-and-Clone-Oppia) ([why?](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Why-fork-and-clone-Oppia%3F)) the Oppia repo so that it gets downloaded into opensource/oppia.
3. Follow the instructions for your platform:
   * [Linux](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-(Linux;-Python-3))
   * [Mac OS](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-(Mac-OS;-Python-3))
   * [Windows](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Windows%29) (might be a bit complicated, we recommend to use Linux or Mac if you can)
4. You might need to install an older version of Oppia that uses Python 2 (only do this when you need to get some older code working or you need to make some changes to a release that is not in Python 3 yet), follow these instructions for your platform:
   * [Linux](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Linux%29)
   * [Mac OS](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Mac-OS%29)
   * [Windows](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Windows%29) (might be a bit complicated, we recommend to use Linux or Mac if you can)
5. If you run into any problems during installation, please read [these notes](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Issues-with-installation%3F) and the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Troubleshooting) page.
