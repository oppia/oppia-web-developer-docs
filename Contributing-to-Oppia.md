Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia project! There are many ways to help, and not all of them are technical -- for instance, you could create a new exploration on [oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), or fix a bug in the [Oppia codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/).

The rest of this page contains information about specific ways to help out. If you run into any problems, please feel free to report a bug using our [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues), or get help via our [discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia).

### Do you like explaining things to others, and helping people learn new stuff? ###

If so, here is how you can help!

  * You could create a new exploration on [oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), or edit an existing one to make it clearer and more useful for learners.

  * You could also make a really good learning experience that combines multiple Oppia explorations and/or other resources to help someone effectively learn something. It may seem as though this may not be directly helping the Oppia project, but the reason we built Oppia is to try and make it easier for people to create effective learning experiences for everyone and increase the number of such things that are available on the Web. So, if you've created something along these lines and would like to share it, we'd love to hear from you!

  * When making an exploration, you might find that you would be able to convey the intuition better if only you had a particular type of functionality -- but alas, Oppia may not offer it. If that happens, please file an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues) -- that way, there's at least a chance that a friendly contributor will decide to build it one day, and then you (and others) will be able to use it. But we won't know that you need it unless you tell us!

  * If you've had previous experience working with the Oppia codebase, and would like to mentor new volunteers, please tell us. We'd like to make contributing to Oppia a formative experience, and, for a newcomer to open-source development, having someone to turn to for help and advice (or just a second pair of eyes) would go a long way.

### Do you like making beautiful things? Can you draw? Do you enjoy designing? ###

If so, here is how you can help!

  * If you'd like to help with site design, please send an email to the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev) or to admin@oppia.org. We're currently short of designers on the core team, so offers of help would be very welcome.

  * Many explorations are more fun when they come with art, and many concepts are better explained with pictures than with a dense chunk of words. So, if you see an opportunity for a picture or graphic to make an exploration clearer or more engaging, please feel free to contribute it! You should be able to go to its editor page and upload an image directly.

### Can you code? Is there a bug that you'd like to fix, or a feature you'd like to work on? Would you like to help with development in general? ###

If so, here is how you can help!

(By the way, you might also like to take a look at [this page](GettingStarted.md) for instructions on downloading a local copy of Oppia.)

  * Fix a bug. We've got lots of stuff on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues) that could do with some fixing, and quite a lot of other stuff that isn't even on the issue tracker. This is a great way to get started with the codebase, so if you'd like to try your hand at addressing a small bug before diving deeper, let us know and we can find something for you!

  * Build a new feature. We have many ideas for the project, but not enough time to do all of them. These include making it easy to chain explorations into longer 'adventures', building an internationalization pipeline, improving the profile page, adding more useful information for exploration editors, allowing learners to make quick typo fixes and small edits, and many more. You might also have ideas of your own! If you are interested in working on any of these initiatives, or would like to contribute in a particular way, let us know.

  * Contribute a new interaction. Oppia explorations are built out of interactions which allow learners to provide answers and receive feedback on their work. We've tried to make it easy to extend Oppia with new, custom interactions, and welcome contributions for additional ones. For example, some of our contributors are currently working on interactions that allow a learner to enter a number with units (for physics/chemistry), or a chess move. If you have other ideas for ways in which the reader could communicate with Oppia -- such as via algebraic expressions, or via a drawing -- and you'd like to make it possible for Oppia to understand these input formats too, please tell us.

  * Write tests. The Oppia project could do with more tests -- we have pretty good coverage on the backend (94% at last count, in June 2015), but our frontend and integration coverage is spotty. Tests are important because they help prevent developers from accidentally making code break when they write new changes, and so any help towards improving the project's test coverage would be very welcome.

A couple of extra pointers:

  * Please talk to us before you start working on a change! This helps avoid duplication of effort, and makes it possible for us to offer advice and suggestions, or point you to the relevant files. A post to the [developers list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev) is probably the best way to do this, though you could also send an email to admin@oppia.org.

  * Please note that, before we can accept any commits you make, you'll need to sign a [CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).

  * You might also like to take a look at the [developer documentation](Documentation.md).

### Do you have a methodical approach to things? Do you enjoy helping something become high-quality and free of defects? ###

If so, here is how you can help!

  * Tell us about defects. Play around with Oppia, create some explorations, try to do things. If anything breaks, please tell us about it on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues) so that we can fix it! Most of the development team works with Chrome on Ubuntu Linux, so if you have a different OS or a different browser and can help us with testing that Oppia works correctly in those as well, that would be really useful.

  * We have a bunch of documentation on our wiki. Unfortunately, it is incomplete and tends to get out of sync with the code pretty quickly. If you notice this, and would like to help us update the docs (or write new or better ones), that would be very welcome, since we don't want to mislead anyone.

### Are you a nice and friendly person? ###

If so, here is how you can help!

  * We would love Oppia to be a friendly, welcoming project for newcomers to open source. If you would like to help us welcome volunteers, answer their questions, and match them to opportunities to help, that would be great! If this is of interest, please let us know by sending an email to admin@oppia.org.

  * One other thing we would love is for Oppia to be used. If you know a great teacher (or someone who loves helping other people learn), feel free to tell them that this project exists, and that they are more than welcome to use it!

### Would you like to help, but are not sure how? ###

If so ... please let us know! Oppia is a very multi-faceted project, and we'll almost certainly be able to find something matching your interests and skills. See the links below for how to get in touch.
