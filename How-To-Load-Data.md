   3. Reload a single collection: This section has preloaded collections.
   4. Load dummy new structures data: This section provides a combination of topics, skills, stories, and exploration.
   5. Generate dummy skill with questions.
   6. Generate a dummy math classroom.

### Creating a Classroom

1. We must first navigate to the `CONFIG` tab in the admin page.
2. In this tab, there is a section `The details for each classroom page.` in which you will find a default math classroom that is filled out.
3. It has details about the classroom:
   1. Name
   2. URL Fragment
   3. topic list intro
   4. topic ids: The topic ids that should be included in the classroom are listed here. We can add to this by clicking on the `Add element` option.
4. More classrooms can be generated by clicking on the `Add element` option beneath this section.
5. Once the classroom details have been filled, to complete the process we must save changes by clicking the `Save` button at the bottom left corner of the `CONFIG` tab.
6. If the classroom has been created successfully, you will be able to see a message `Data successfully saved` at the bottom right corner of the screen.
7. The newly created classroom will be visible in the `Home` tab of the learner dashboard page, or we can directly access the classroom from the link `localhost:8181/learn/<classroom-url-fragment>`.
